# Advent of Code

## Setup

1. Install Node and npm (preferably with nvm)

2. Install dependencies:

```shell
npm i
```

3. Add `.env` file using `sample.env` template:

```text

```

You can get the cookie by authorizing within Advent of Code, and then grabbing the cookie that's sent with your request (for instance, for an input):
